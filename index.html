<h1> Hello and Welcome to Omar's page </h1>

  <li style="color:blue;"> Summary: </li>
  <p>
I am currently finalizing my Advanced Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence, at KU Leuven, focused on theoretical and applied Data Science (‘Data Mining’, ‘Machine Learning and Inductive Inference’, ‘Advanced Analytics in a Big Data World’...).
  </p>
  <p>
As a Data Scientist Intern at KPMG-Belgium, I worked on the topic of Bias and Fairness in AI, where I demonstrated the necessity of the implementation of fairness techniques on ML models throughout a case study.
I am also a Civil Engineering graduate from Université Saint Joseph De Beyrouth - ESIB, specialized in transportation and public works.

I was part of a team of three in my Final Year Project, where we worked on Modeling and Optimizing the Traffic Signals of multiple intersections in Tripoli, Lebanon's second largest city.
  </p>
  <p>
  I have an analytical mindset, in addition to my positive and enthusiastic personality.
